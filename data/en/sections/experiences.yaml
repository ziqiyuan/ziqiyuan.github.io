    responsibilities:
    - Designed and tested polarization, transmit, and receiver circuitries for the coils of an Earthâ€™s Field NMR system that could be used to estimate the water content of underground crops.
    - Modified and soldered PCBs for the receiver circuitry to amplify and filter the received signal in the order of a few microvolts at the expected frequency. Implemented a pre-amplifier, a 4th order Butterworth filter, and a final amplifier with an adjustable gain in the receiver.
    - Integrated the device with a FRDM-K64F board to control the signal sequence. Configured Python code to send various transmit sequences. Analyzed the received signal with MATLAB.
